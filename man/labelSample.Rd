\usage{
labelSample(xy = xy, rad = rad, npt = NULL, npx = NULL, pxr = pxr)
}
\arguments{
\item{xy}{Object of class \emph{SpatialPoints} of \emph{SpatialPointsDataFrame}.}

\item{rad}{Minimum radius. Unit depends on the projection of the data.}

\item{npt}{Minimum pixel count per pixel.}

\item{npx}{Minimum number of pixels.}

\item{pxr}{Pixel resolution os a valid raster layer.}
}
\value{
A \emph{vector}.
}
\description{
Region labeling of samples based on their spatial connectivity.
}
\details{
{First, the samples are converted to pixel coordinates and then one  
of two occur: 1) if \emph{npt} is set, the function removes pixels with a pixel 
count smaller than the one specified; 2) If \emph{npx} is set, the connectivity 
between neighboring samples is evaluated and regions with a count small than the 
specified value are filtered. Only one option may be set at a time. Then, the 
remaining pixels are dilated and the samples are again labeled accounting for 
regions that are not connected but are near to each other. Regions within a given 
distance of each other (defined by \emph{rad}) are aggregated. The grid used for 
this analysis is built from the spatial extent of \emph{xy} and a given pixel 
resolution (\emph{pxr}). If \emph{pxr} is a raster, this will be used to define 
the dimensions of the grid. Doing so can be of use when the user has pre-select 
environmental predictors that will be used for modeling. Note that the finer the 
resolution the more independent regions are likely to be returned. The output is 
a vector with ID's assigning each sample to its region. Samples filtered by 
\emph{npt} or \emph{npx} will be returned as zeros.}
